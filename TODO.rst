TODO
====

- More detailed checking in regex for:

  - char constant (done)
  - string constant (done)

- Fix:

  - check global definition when semantic analysis finishes
  - local function declaration is not in a local scope

- Not Implemented:

  - complex type name (to be in agreement with complex decl) (almost done)
  - initializer checking
  - typedef support (via adding mid-rule actions to bision to inform flex)
